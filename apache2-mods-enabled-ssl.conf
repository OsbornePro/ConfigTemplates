        # The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a mechanism for determining
        # whether or not a server certificate has been revoked, and OCSP Stapling is a
        # special form of this in which the server, such as httpd and mod_ssl, maintains
        # current OCSP responses for its certificates and sends them to clients which
        # communicate with the server. Most certificates contain the address of an OCSP
        # responder maintained by the issuing Certificate Authority, and mod_ssl can
        # communicate with that responder to obtain a signed response that can be sent
        # to clients communicating with the server.
